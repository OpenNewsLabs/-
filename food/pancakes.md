# Pancakes

## The Basics
* 20 minutes prep
* Serves 8 people
* Needs pan, mixing container, spatula for flipping

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 1/4 cups milk
* 1 egg
* 3 tablespoons butter, melted


## Directions

* Mix the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. 

* Beat the egg with a fork, add milk and melted butter.

* Pour wet things into dry things. Mix until cohesive.

* Heat a lightly oiled (or buttered) frying pan over medium-high heat.

* Add three small scoops with a soup spoon to the pan.

* Count about a minute and flip over; watch for nice coloring (Adjust time for subsequent pancakes accordingly). Second side needs about 80% of first side. Serve hot.

### Notes

* Don't mix too much! You want the air in the mix to keep the pancakes fluffy. Mix just enough that its uniform (but not completely smooth).

* For best results make the batter right before cooking. The recipe can be double by doubling ingredients.

* You can make massive pan-sized pancakes but smaller circles are best (cook faster) and people eat more (I don't know why. Humans.)

* If making a large batch, place ready pancakes into a container and cover with a dish towel while making more to keep warm. Alternatively you can stow away in an oven or microwave.
