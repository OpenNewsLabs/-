# Salmorejo

## Introduction

[Salmorejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmorejo) is a summer tomato cold soup originally from CÃ³rboda in the south of Spain

## The Basics

* 20 minutes prep
* 1 hour on the fridge
* Serves 8 people
* Needs mixer, tall mixing container, big recipient to store it on the fridge

## Ingredients

* 1 kg mature red tomatoes
* 1 Clove of garlic
* 150 ml of olive oil
* 200 grams of white bread (if it is from yesterday even better)
* Seasoning: salt (around 10 grams)
* 4 eggs (Optional)
* 150 grams of spanish cured ham (Optional)


## Directions

* Clean the tomatoes cut them in 4 chunks and put them in a tall mixing container 

* Mix thoroughly with the mixer until you get a homogeneous liquid.

* Cut the bread in small chunks and add it to the mix, let them soak for 10 minutes.

    * That way the bread will get soft if it is from yesterday

* Peel the garlic clove cut it in half longitudinally, optionally remove the center part and add it to the mix

* Add the olive oil to the mix and remix thoroughly until you get a nice liquid paste texture. Add salt based on your preferences

* Pour the mix into a big recipient and store it into the fridge

* _Optional_:
    
    * Boil the eggs for 20 minutes, peel them and cut in small dices and put it in a bowl

    * Cut the spanish ham in small dices and put it in a bowl

    * The egss and ham are used to put over the salmorejo individually on the table at serving time  

### Notes

* The bread and olive oil are the ones responsible for the texture of the Salmorejo is it is too liquid you can try to add a little bit more of olive oil and remix until you get a better texture.

* It is meant to serve cold so leave it in the fridge for at least an hour.

* We use the remains for breakfast the next day just spread it over a toast....delicious!!!
