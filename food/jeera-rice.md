# Jeera Rice

## The Basics
* 20 minutes prep
* Serves 2 people
* Needs a glass microwave container

## Ingredients

* 1 cup basmati rice
* 2 1/2 cups water
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tsp butter or ghee
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)


## Directions

* Wash the rice in warm water and drain.

* Place the ghee or butter at the bottom of the glass bowl. cover with rice

* Add the cumin seeds and water.

* Cook on high for about 15 min in the microwave.

* Mix well and serve.


### Notes

* The actual cooking time varies.

* It is good to check at about 12 min to gauge the amount of time required.

* If it is too liquidy, give it some more time. If it looks too dry add about 1/4 cup water and cook for another 4 min.

* The top layer may look dry. But mixing the rice when it is still steaming will solve the problem
