# Pi

### The Basics
* group word game
* 3 to &#8734; players
* best after some drinks

### Rules

Each player say a number out loud starting from 1. The player must use Roman numerals (1 = I, 2 = II, etc).

The player next to them (left or right), says the subsequent number and so on.

When a number ends in 7 (like 17) or is divisible by seven (like 14), the player must say Pi instead of the number. 

When Pi is said out loud, the order switches so if clock-wise it switches to counter clockwise.

If a player fails to say Pi at the right moment, the game is over.

### Variations

When a player fails to say Pi at the right moment, that player is excluded from the game and the game continues until all are excluded and there is one victorious OpenNews Fellow standing.

#### Roman numbers reminder

* 1 = I
* 5 = V
* 10 = X
* 50 = L
* 100 = C
* 500 = D
* 1000 = M

28 = XXVIII....wrong!!! 28 is Pi ;-)
