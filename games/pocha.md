# Pocha

## Intro

Pocha, called also Podrida or [Oh Hell](http://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html), is a Spanish card game very extended in different countries, due to the high number of versions. Pocha is a trick game in which the object is not to obtain more or less tricks, but to guess in advance how many tricks a player will win.


## Object of the game

The object is for each player to bid the number of tricks he thinks he can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. 

Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly, and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or
under.

The hook is that at least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.

## The pack

Pocha is played with a[Spanish deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_playing_cards) of 40 cards.

## Number of players

For Pocha, at least three players are needed, but the most interesting one is played by four or five people.
When three players take part in the game, the twos are removed from the pack, so that all the players receive the same number of cards when all the pack is dealt.

## Rank and value of cards

For all suits, the rank of cards, from highest to lowest, is: ace, three, king (12), horse (11), jack (10), seven, six, five, four and two.
The cards have no value in points since just the number of tricks won or lost by each player is considered.

## The deal

The first dealer is chosen at random and the player to his right will be the leader. The dealer shuffles the cards and the player to dealer's left cuts the pack. The dealer will distribute the appropriate number of cards for the hand being played, one at a time, anticlockwise. 

The next card is turned face up and the suit of this card is the trump suit for the hand. The remaining undealt cards are placed in a face down stock with the turned trump on top of it.

When all the pack is distributed, the last card of the pack, which belongs to the dealer, is turned face up, determining the trump suit. When the other players have seen it, the dealer can pick it up and play it in the same way as the other cards.

## The play

A definite number of hands are played during the game. The winner is the player who gets the highest score at the end of the game.

Players start with only one card in the first hand. The number of cards that every player receives is increased by one in every hand, until all the cards of the pack are dealt. All the cards are dealt as many times as players take part in the game. Usually, the
return is made by decreasing the number of cards, and finally one only card is played again.

The leader leads the first trick playing any card in his hand. There is an obligation of assisting, beating, trumping and overtrumping. 

When a player cannot follow the suit led or play a trump, any card can be played. If the leader plays a trump, the rest of the players must overtrump it, even if they do not have a higher trump. 

In this case, if a player has not got a card trump in his hand, any card can be played.

Each trick is won by the highest trump played to it, or if no trump is played, by the highest card of the suit led. The completed tricks are stored face down in front of the player. 

The winner of each trick begins the next one.

The hand finishes when all the cards in the players’ hands have been played.

The winner of the game is the player with the highest score after the end of the last hand. If there is a tie, another hand is dealt and played until the tie is broken.

## Bidding

The bidding in each hand begins with the player to the dealer’s left, then continues anticlockwise, back around to the dealer, who bids last. 

Each bid is a bet representing the number of tricks that player will try to take. Everyone must bid. It is not possible to pass, but you can bid zero, in which case your object is to take no tricks at all. A bid may be changed only if the next player to the left has not yet bid. According to the hook, the dealer may not bid the number that would cause the total number of tricks bid to equal the number of tricks available. 

A hand will always be "over-bid" or "under-bid". It is very important to keep in mind when
bidding that not all cards in the pack are in play in any hand.

## The scoring

After playing all the tricks of the hand, the scores are updated according to the number of tricks obtained by each player and the bid made before playing the cards. 

The players who win the exact number of tricks bid, score 10 points plus 5 points for each
trick obtained in the hand.

The players that do not hit their own number of tricks, get 5 points minus for each trick of difference, even if they “over-bid” or “under-bid” regarding their bids.

The scorekeeper is designated prior to each game. The designated scorekeeper notes each bid and resulting scores on a score sheet. The score sheet is usually divided in columns. The first column is used to indicate the number of cards corresponding to each hand and in the other ones, for each player, their bids, their scores of the played hand and their total score are noted.
