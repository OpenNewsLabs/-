## Setup
- Take a regular deck of cards and remove the cards of values from 2 to 5. You can just use the deck as-is if playing with Spanish playing cards.
- Deal 6 cards to each player.
- Place the remaining cards in the center of the table - this stack of cards is called the _talon_.
- Reveal the top card of the talon and place it under the talon so that it is visible. The suit of this card is the _trump_ suit.
- Whoever has the smallest trump card reveals it and goes first.

## Play
- The current player _attacks_ the player to their left.
    - The attacker plays a card from their hand. If they have other cards of that value, they can play those simultaneously, or they can play them later in this encounter.
    - The defender can defeat an attacking card by playing a higher-value card that matches the attacking card's suit or by playing any card of the trump suit (unless the attacking card is also of the trump suit; in which case the defender must player a trump suit card of a higher value).
    - At any moment, the attacker _or other non-defending_ players can join in the attack by playing cards from their hands which match the value of _any_ card involved in the encounter (even if it is a card the defender played).
    - The maximum number of attacking cards in an encounter is either 6 or the number of cards in the defender's hand, if it less than 6. That is, there cannot be more attacking cards than the defender can defend again.
- The attack is resolved:
    - If the defender successfully beats every attacking card, all cards involved in the encounter are discarded.
    - If the defender fails to beat all attacking cards, they pick up all cards involved in the encounter.
    - Everyone involved in the encounter draws from the talon until they have 6 cards again (if the talon is depleted, ignore this rule), starting with the attacker and going right (so the defender draws last).
- If the defender lost the encounter, their turn is skipped. Otherwise, they attack the player to their left.
- The last person who still has cards is the loser (the fool, _durak_).

For the next game, the fool shuffles and deals. The player to their left attacks first (that is, the fool defends first).
