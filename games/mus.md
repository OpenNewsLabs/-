# Mus

## Intro

[Mus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus_(card_game)) is one of the most popular Spanish card games, of Basque origin.

It is quite complex since it has four subgames in each hand played...so I am going to leave it to the professionals.

## Rules

[Here](http://www.pagat.com/vying/mus.html) are the rules much better explained that I could try to, thanks to [pagat](http://www.pagat.com/) if you don't know the website it is really good for card games.

### Notes

* Sometimes is played with some money (1 dollar each game) involved so that you don't say "Ã“rdago" (a kind of All-in) too cheerfully. The winners of the game stay on the table and another two partners join.

* You need 20 piedras (Can be made with paper balls or chickpeas if available). One partner has unit piedras (worth 1 point each) the other partner has 5 unit piedras (worth 5 points each)...that way you don't need 40 piedras....yes we are efficient in Spain!!
