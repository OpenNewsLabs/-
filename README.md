🍎🍎🍎 Manzana  🍎🍎🍎

During the 2015 Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires [Media Party](http://mediaparty.info/) the [2015 OpenNews fellows](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/2015meet/) stayed together at an AirBnB and did lots of coooking and card playing. We thought it would be a good idea to capture all the wonderful things we learned and encourage other fellows to expand on it as they hang out.

The Manzana is an homage to Kavya's Duolingo bug, which forced her to only learn spanish with sentences about apples.
