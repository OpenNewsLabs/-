# Getting started - Day 1
Congratulations! You are ready to start your fellowship. It is exciting. But it can also be overwhelming as you try to fit into a newsroom.

Fellowship is quite unique. As a fellow you are not an employee or an intern. You are not on the news org’s payroll, at least not directly. This might throw up some unique challenges especially with first-time hosts.

This is a checklist of things to go over with your host.


## Travel and Time off
-	Set expectation upfront that you might be traveling about a third of your fellowship.
-	Ask them if there are any specific events that the host wants you to attend. For instance, Vox has VAX.
-	Ask if there are any additional travel requirements.
-	Learn how to inform the team of your conference and other fellowship travel plans.
-	Make sure to ask about the organization’s vacation policy.
-	Learn how to request time off.

## Access and restrictions
-	Make sure you have your work email, work wifi, Slack, Hipchat, etc. set up
-	Make sure you have access to the repos you need to work on.
-	Make sure you have access to the newsroom's content management system.
-	Get key card or badge required to get into the building.
-	Make sure that you have access to team calendar and that you are invited to all relevant meetings
-	Ask if there is anything that is off-limit to you as a fellow.
-	Talk about morale budget related policy – Are there any events that a fellow cannot participate in? Happy hour, team travel, etc.?
- Find out whom to talk to in case of access issues

## Work culture
-	Learn about the organizations workflow for content and code. For instance, do you have a code review process? Do you directly push to master or make pull requests? How do you get content edited?
-	Ask for the best way to get help if you are stuck. For instance, should you ask in a slack room, or ask someone directly, or set up a meeting, etc.?
-	Set up a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly 1:1 with your mentor.
-	Set both long term and short term goals.
-	Since you are going to travel a lot, it might be required to work remotely sometimes. So ask about remote working policy.

## Sharing your work
-	Set expectation that you will be talking about work in the public, on OpenNews calls, conferences, etc.
-	Ask if there are things that you should not talk about.
-	Invite news org to attend OpenNews calls
